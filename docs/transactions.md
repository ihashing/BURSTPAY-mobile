# Transaction History 交易記錄

BURSTPAY Wallet Application offers you a history of the last 15 transactions recorded for an account. A list containing ingoing and outgoing transactions with their according amounts. Ingoing transactions (indicated by a green arrow) state the sender's addresses and outgoing transactions (indicated by a red arrow) state the recipient's addresses. In addition, the exact dates are displayed, when transactions were executed. 

BURSTPAY電子錢包應用程序可為您提供一個帳戶記錄的最近15筆交易的歷史記錄。包含轉入和轉出交易及其相應金額的列表。轉入交易（由綠色箭頭指示）說明了發件人的地址，而轉出交易（由紅色箭頭指示）說明了收件人的地址。此外，還會顯示執行交易時的確切日期。


Transactions with transaction messages list the corresponding message text. Encrypted texts can be decrypted via the decryption dialog. The decryption dialog can be opened by tapping on the encrypted text. Currently, encrypted texts sent withh the desktop wallet cannot be decrypted with the mobile wallet, since gzip was avoided in the implementation.

帶有交易信息的交易列出了相應的信息文本。可以通過解密對話框對加密的信息文本進行解密。可以通過點擊加密信息文本來打開解密對話框。當前，與桌面錢包一起發送的加密文本無法使用移動錢包解密，因為在實現中避免使用gzip。


## Unconfirmed Transactions 未確認的交易
The history also shows unconfirmed transactions, which are currently being processed. Unconfirmed transactions are indicated by a blue refresh sign instead of a green check mark on the right side.

歷史記錄還顯示當前正在處理的未確認交易。未確認的交易由藍色刷新符號代替右側的綠色複選標記表示。
